The Regina Zoning Bylaw, 2019 oversees and provides regulations for land use and development within Regina. The Bylaw also controls and regulates the construction, reconstruction, alteration and use of buildings, structures and land for residence, business, industrial and other specified uses.
These regulations determine what can be built on a parcel of land taking into consideration the other land uses surrounding that property or within a neighbourhood. These zones protect the character and stability of neighbourhoods while promoting orderly development through regulations that relate to building use, height and placement on the property.
The Zoning Bylaw aligns with Design Regina: The Official Community Plan which outlines long-term goals and policies to guide the physical, environmental, social and cultural development of Regina.

Narrator: The City is updating its Zoning Bylaw. But what does this really mean for you and your neighbourhood? |
Simplified illustrations of the city skyline. |
|
Here’s a quick lesson on what zoning is and why it’s important to everyone. |
Dotted lines begin segmenting the visual and break up to reveal the words “Zoning 101”. |
|
Zoning determines the most ideal locations for development… |
The Regina city limits is outlined. Inside the limits is the word “Regina”. |
|
…taking into account things like transportation networks, nearby businesses and residential neighbourhoods, and land conditions such as areas that are prone to flooding. |
Small labels appear, revealing land use types randomly across the area. These types are industrial, residential, commercial and recreational. Transportation networks, nearby businesses and residential neighbourhood iconography appear. |
|
Zoning facilitates community growth by regulating broad land use categories for how land can be used. These include residential, commercial, industrial and recreational. |
Individual puzzle pieces labelled “Residential”, “Industrial”, “Recreational” and “Commercial”. |
|
In other words, zones are like puzzle pieces, each relating to a type of land use. When all of those pieces are put together, they form the city we live in… |
All of the puzzle pieces fit together. |
|
…as with puzzle pieces, each zone has unique characteristics, yet each is made to connect and fit with the pieces around it. |
The puzzle morphs into the outline of the city limits. The words “Our City” is in the middle. |
|
Zoning also regulates the types of buildings that can be built and where they can be located on a property. |
The city limits outline morphs into a skinny rectangle, representing the ground. Different types of buildings pop up from the ground. One mismatched building gets swapped out for one that fits. |
|
Which also includes development standards for a building, such as lot area, lot width, building height and how far a building must be set back from the property line. |
A blueprint rolls open from left to right. The wire frame of a building animates onto the blueprint. The blueprint then rolls back to transition to the next frame. |
|
Zoning also impacts specific parking and landscaping… |
Grass appears from the bottom of the frame, followed by the hedge in the background. Clouds start to roll in from the right of the frame. A house and shed spring up from the ground. |
|
…and the requirements for other structures on the property. |
Trees pop up from the ground in the background. Everything moves down to transition to the next frame. |
|
Zoning bylaws help us create liveable, vibrant communities. For this reason, zoning touches on all aspects of our daily lives and the spaces we interact within the city. |
A map of Regina appears and random zones get individually highlighted (i.e. residential, business, etc.) Everything moves from left to right, transitioning to the next slide. |
|
Your vision for our city helped shape our Official Community Plan “Design Regina”, which provides long-term growth policies and development goals for the future. Now, the Zoning Bylaw will help move us closer to making that vision a reality over the next 25 years. |
A book slides in from the left side of the screen, and the cityscape pops out of the book. Zoning arrows with the words “25 years” slide in from the left. Zoom in on the cityscape. |
|
We want to be Canada’s most vibrant, inclusive, attractive and sustainable community, where people live in harmony and thrive in opportunity. |
Clouds float in and a row of trees pop up from left to right. Everything moves up to transition to the next slide. |
|
The new Zoning Bylaw fosters the development of complete neighbourhoods where residents of all ages have the access they need to housing, work and services that enhance their quality of life. |
Three icons appear. From left to right, the icons are of a house, a person sitting at a desk and a shopping cart. The text for each icon, again from left to right, is “Housing”, “Work” and “Services”. After a few seconds, the image of each icon disappears, and the white background of the icons expand. |
|
This means providing flexibility for diverse types of housing and businesses to share space in new and existing neighbourhoods, while also ensuring the unique character of each neighbourhood is supported. |
Various types of office/business buildings slide into frame following the zoning areas. On a lower plane, various types of housing slide in from the opposite direction to form a small community within a city. Everything slides down out of frame. |
|
For most neighbourhoods, if there are changes, they will be gradual and happen over a long period of time. |
Zone Forward arrows move across the screen, adding colour to the line drawings of the future neighbourhood development. First the top row, followed by the bottom row. The illustrations move off the right following the Zone arrows. |
|
The Zoning Bylaw is just one of many tools used by municipalities to realize city building goals and objective. |
A Zoning Bylaw book slides into frame from the left. |
|

The City of Regina logo fades in. The logo then fades out, and the zoning URL fades in. It reads “Regina.ca/zoningbylaw 306-777-7000”. |
10 Times Zoning Applies to You
| 1. When thinking about building a house: The Zoning Bylaw determines what kind of housing is permitted in each zone, the maximum area it can occupy on the lot, and the maximum allowable height. |
| 2. When planning to build a new garage: The Bylaw identifies the maximum size and appropriate placement of both detached and attached garages. |
| 3. When building or expanding the deck on your property: The Bylaw specifies how close decks are permitted to be to the property line. |
| 4. When planning to add to the front or back of your house: The Bylaw specifies how close the addition can be to the property line and the maximum area the complete building can occupy. |
| 5. When thinking about starting a business in your home: The Bylaw indicates the types of uses that are prohibited as a residential business and the maximum area the business can occupy in your home. |
| 6. When thinking about developing a secondary suite: The Bylaw indicates the types of buildings that can have a secondary suite and the maximum size of the secondary suite. |
| 7. When planning to build or expand your driveway: The Bylaw specifies which yard (front, side or rear) can have a driveway and the maximum width of the driveway. |
| 8. When planning to put a storage shed in your yard: The Bylaw identifies the yard (front, side or rear) where a shed can be placed and the maximum size of the shed. |
| 9. When thinking about changing your land use: The Bylaw specifies which land uses are allowed in which zones. |
| 10. When thinking of starting a daycare facility: The Bylaw indicates the amount of drop-off spaces required for the daycare. |

- You must obtain a building permit before you begin construction.
Operating a Residential Business
Visit the Business Licences section if you're planning on starting a residential business.
Putting up a Sign
Review Chapter 11 for regulations around all types of signs.
Portable or Permanent Signs
A portable sign is described in the Zoning Bylaw as “a sign used for on-site or off-site advertising that is mounted on a trailer, stand or similar support structure which is designed in such a manner that the sign can readily be relocated to provide advertising at another location, and does not include signs painted directly on motor vehicles."
All portable signs located within Regina require a permit. You do not need a permit if you are renting or leasing a portable sign from a sign rental company as it is the company’s responsibility to obtain the permit. Please reference the Portable Sign Guide for more information.
To apply for a portable sign permit
Complete and submit your Portable Sign Permit Application to City Hall with your application fee. If approved, your portable sign permit is valid between July 1 to June 30 of the next year.
Other signs
A sign is described in the Zoning Bylaw as “any writing, number, image, picture, emblem, symbol, trademark, flag, banner, pennant, or other figure of similar character which is a structure, or is attached to, displayed on, or in any manner represented on a building or structure; is used as a visual medium to announce, direct attention to, inform, identify or advertise; and is intended to be visible from outside a building.”
A permit is required for any changes to a permanent sign. A permit is also needed if you alter the business name on the sign to a new one.
To apply for a sign permit
Read Chapter 11 to learn the regulations and standards for signs. If your proposed sign meets these requirements, complete and submit your Permanent Sign Permit Application to City Hall with your application fee.
Fees
| Portable Sign Permit | $44 |
| Permanent Sign Permit | $260 |
| Permanent Sign Permit - Video | $500 |

Obtaining Approvals
Development options and alternatives may be suggested by City staff during the application review to ensure compliance with the Zoning Bylaw. Below are details about the most requested information involving the Zoning Bylaw.
Development Permit
Development Permit Applications determine if the use of land, building or other structures may be developed at a specific location. A permit will be issued authorizing a development according to the Zoning Bylaw.
When you are considering developing on a piece of property or changing the land use, contact us to determine the zoning of the property. If the use of your proposed development is considered discretionary, you must first apply for a discretionary use application and receive approval from City Council.
With the Development Permit Applications please also include:
- Site Plan
- Landscape Plan
- Floor Plans
- Elevations
- Consent letter from the Property Owner (if applicant is different from owner)
Minor Zoning Variance
A minor variance is a variation of regulations, requirements and standards of the Zoning Bylaw. A list of the types of regulations that can be varied are located in Chapter 1 of the Zoning Bylaw.
The maximum amount of the minor variance cannot exceed 10% variation of the zoning bylaw requirements. Your development must still conform to the zoning bylaw with respect to the use of the land.
To apply
Read and submit the Minor Variance Application Form, and submit it to City Hall (2476 Victoria Avenue). You will also have to include site plans and the application fee with the form.
If you are successful
You will be notified by the City when your Minor Zoning Variance has been approved. Note: Being granted a zoning minor variance does not exempt you from meeting applicable building code and building bylaw requirements.
To appeal
You may appeal the refusal of a Minor Zoning Variance to the Development Appeals Board within 30 days of you being notified of this refusal. To appeal, read and complete a Development Appeal Application Form.
Secondary Suites
Your proposed secondary suite must meet strict building code and zoning bylaw regulations. The Secondary Suite regulations lists the requirements involving windows, fire protection, forced-entry protection, separation of dwelling units, soundproofing, smoke alarms, handrails, room heights, air duct system, furnaces, plumbing, exits and address naming conventions for your secondary suite. Under the Zoning Bylaw, secondary suites are allowed in most residential zones.
To Apply
- Complete the Secondary Suite Permit Submission Package and ensure your application contains all required information and documents. Incomplete submissions will not be accepted. The project package may be updated at any time, be sure to check back to this web page for the most current project package.
- A completed Residential Permit Fee Calculation Form is required as part of the application.
- The application must be signed by the legal owner of the property as well as the applicant.
- If applicable, contact SaskPower for inspections and permits for gas or electrical work.
- Submit your application between 8 a.m. and 4:45 p.m. weekdays at City Hall. The City will review your application to ensure it meets all building, heritage, zoning, landscaping, engineering, environmental, disposal, assessment, open space and utility regulations and/or bylaws.
Once your application is approved, you will receive an email inviting you to pick up your permit and advising you of the permit fee. Your permit is not issued until you have paid the fee and picked it up.
Permit Fee
|
Residential: New 1-2 units construction (cost /m2) |
$9 /m2, $100 minimum |
|
Residential: Movement, alternation, renovation, repair of property |
$8 /$1,000 value, $100 minimum |
Construction cannot begin until the permit is issued. If work commences prior to issuing of a building permit, you will be subject to a surcharge.
Zoning Bylaw Amendment
Land use zones apply to all parcels of land in the city. Zoning determines the possible permitted and discretionary uses of the land parcel, as well as regulations about lot size, coverage, placement of buildings among others.
If you wish to develop or make an improvement to a parcel and it is not in agreement with the zoning, you can request an amendment to the Zoning Bylaw. The most common amendment request involves changes of land use designation or zoning changes.
An outline of the application process is included on the Zoning Bylaw Amendment Form.
Development Appeals
To apply or learn more about eligibility or the development appeal process, view the Development Appeal Application Package.
A development appeal is a request to the Development Appeals Board for a variation of certain zoning regulations within the Zoning Bylaw, as applied to a specific property.
The Development Appeals Board is made up of local citizens appointed by City Council.
An individual has the right to appeal to the Development Appeals Board where the Development Officer:
- Is alleged to have misapplied the Zoning Bylaw in issuing a development permit;
- Refuses to issue a development permit because it would contravene the Zoning Bylaw; or
- Issues an Order to Comply.
Please see Chapter 1 of the Zoning Bylaw for more detailed regulations on what can be appealed.
If you would like a preliminary consultation, please contact us.

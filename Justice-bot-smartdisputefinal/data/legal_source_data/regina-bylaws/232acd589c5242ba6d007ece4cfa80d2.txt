The Office of the City Clerk keeps the latest version of each bylaw on file and will provide a hard copy upon request. There may be a cost associated with a request to print a bylaw.
Control and Destruction of Rats
Rats are very destructive creatures. They destroy and contaminate food, and through their tunneling activities, undermine the foundations of buildings, sewer and water lines, and city streets. The Control and Destruction of Rats Bylaw was established to promote a healthy and safe community for the people of Regina.
Homeowners, tenants and property owners are responsible for controlling and destroying any rats found.

The Office of the City Clerk keeps the latest version of each bylaw on file and will provide a hard copy upon request. There may be a cost associated with a request to print a bylaw.
Community Standards Bylaw
The Community Standards Bylaw was established to regulate the maintenance of properties and structures in the city in an attractive, clean and safe condition and provide for enforcement of those standards.

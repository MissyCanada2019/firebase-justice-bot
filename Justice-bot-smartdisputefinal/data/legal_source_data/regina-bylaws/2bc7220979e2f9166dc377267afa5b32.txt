Changes to Utility Bill
In 2022, City Council approved a new approach to funding waste services such as garbage, recycling, food and yard waste collection. These services will now be funded by a user fee on the utility bill, meaning garbage collection will no longer be funded by property taxes. This portion of the mill rate will be removed from property taxes and customers will see this new Waste Charge beginning January 1, 2024
Understanding Your Taxes
The City of Regina provides more than 60 services that residents depend on every day; approximately 55% is funded through property taxes. In 2024, residents will see a 2.85% mill rate increase.

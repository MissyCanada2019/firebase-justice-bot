The City of Regina has created a Municipal Corporation, named Community & Social Impact Regina (CSIR) that will exist apart from the City and will have more autonomy, flexibility, and the ability to be adaptive and responsive to community needs. Through collaborative approaches, CSIR will create, facilitate and monitor coordinated community and social impact strategies to support the well-being, health, safety, and social inclusion of residents in Regina and region.

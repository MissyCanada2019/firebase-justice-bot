Nunavut was established as a territory on April 1, 1999 by the Nunavut Act (Canada). In accordance with the Act, the laws of Nunavut were duplicated from the Northwest Territories to the extent that they applied, with modifications made when necessary.
On this website, you will find a number of different tools to help you find the legislation you are looking for. Because of Nunavut's unique legislative history, you may have to consult the published statutes, regulations and other statutory instruments of the Northwest Territories to determine the current law of Nunavut.
Consolidations consist of statutes (or laws) and regulations, including amendments. They can be considered a snapshot of the legislation on the “current to” date indicated on their first page. These consolidations are not an official statement of the law, but are prepared for the convenience of users.
Not all laws are consolidated – the Tables of Acts and Tables of Regulations (see below) should be consulted to determine whether anything else may be relevant.
Some provisions may be omitted from the consolidation, such as those that amend or repeal other legislation, or coming into force provisions. Omissions are noted on the cover page of the consolidation.
If you wish to use these consolidations, make sure that you update your information by following these steps:
For Acts:
- Check the most current Tables of Acts to see if the Act has been repealed, is spent or has been amended since the “current to” date of the consolidation;
- Find out if further legislation has been made after the date of the Tables by checking for new Acts in the current year of the Statutes of Nunavut (Annual Volumes);
- Check with the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut for bills that have been passed.
For Regulations and other Statutory Instruments:
- Check the most current Tables of Regulations to see if the regulation or instrument has been repealed, is spent or has been amended since the “current to” date of the consolidation;
- Find out if further legislation has been made after the date of the Tables by checking for new regulations or statutory instruments in Part II of the Nunavut Gazette;
- Check with the Regulations Registry for regulations that have been registered since the date of the last Nunavut Gazette.

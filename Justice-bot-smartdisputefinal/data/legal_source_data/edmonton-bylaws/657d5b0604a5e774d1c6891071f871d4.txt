Community Standards bylaw initiatives focus on education and awareness. We educate the public and students about the rules that help make Edmonton a clean, tidy, and safe place to live. We advocate for animals in our community and work with animal rescue groups. We provide grants and administer common standards. These initiatives enhance our city and encourage everyone to be responsible.

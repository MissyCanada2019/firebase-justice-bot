Animal Control Peace Officers
Animal Control Peace Officers help owners ensure their pets are a positive addition to the community. This is done through education programs, mediating neighbour disputes, providing advice and enforcement.
They enforce the Animal Licensing and Control Bylaw makes owners responsible for their petâ€™s actions, helps return lost pets to their owners and ensures pets are a positive addition to the community. Officers also enforce the Animal Protection Act to ensure pets are well cared for by their owners.
Officers patrol neighbourhoods for stray animals, return lost pets to their owners and respond to animals in distress or animals that have been abandoned.
They also assist the Edmonton Police Service with aggressive or injured animals, Provincial Brand Inspectors with loose livestock and Provincial Conservation Officers with wildlife inside city limits.
Animal Control Peace Officers are sworn peace officers, giving them the ability to write tickets and lay charges that require a pet owner to appear in court.

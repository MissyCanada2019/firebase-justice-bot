Community standards enhance a livable city by supporting safe properties and a civil urban society that meets the standards and expectations of communities. This is accomplished by the identification of standards, together with the education, compliance and, where necessary, enforcement initiatives required to uphold them.
Our enforcement officers help protect residents by promoting compliance with the Cityâ€™s community standards while ensuring a sense of safety and security for all.

Our officers respond to regulatory enforcement needs that require an immediate response by being out in neighbourhoods and on public roads. Any bylaw complaints these teams receive are normally investigated within 1-4 days, depending on the priority.
They are a great resource for bylaw questions or concerns.
Their units focus on specific types of regulatory enforcement:
- Commercial vehicles: including responsive and proactive enforcement involving the commercial transport industry relating to cargo securement, truck routes, dangerous goods transportation and oversized/overweight vehicles
- Vehicles for hire: including checking licensing and regulatory compliance relating to taxis, limos, transportation network vehicles (examples: Uber and Lyft) and other livery vehicles
- Downtown team: including patrolling and responding to concerns in and around the Civic Centre, City Hall and other adjacent infrastructure to enhance safety
- Community standards: including illegal dumping, littering, illegal signage or other visual obstructions on city roads, infill construction concerns, tree and asset protection, excessive vehicle noise along with construction/residential/industrial noise
Municipal Enforcement Officers work with residents in neighbourhoods and business communities to ensure that Edmonton's basic community standards are maintained to a reasonable level. If activities or property conditions don't meet acceptable municipal standards, they provide education, warnings, inspections, and apply penalties.
Municipal Enforcement Officers enforce bylaws to deal with common complaints such as:
- Boulevard Concerns
- Garbage Storage
- Minimum Maintenance of Buildings
- Nuisance Properties
- Recreational Vehicle Parking
- Sidewalk Snow Removal
- Signs
- Weeds
Transit Peace Officers are highly trained and skilled professionals. They patrol in uniform on ETS vehicles and property including buses, LRT and transit stations 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They help create safe environments, provide customer assistance and promote fare compliance.
The Transit Peace Officer Bike Patrol is also active during suitable weather conditions from spring until fall. The Bike Patrol can access certain areas better than a vehicle, such as bike paths along LRT tracks or areas congested by traffic and special events.
Transit Peace Officers are authorized to enforce municipal bylaws and have powers and authority under several provincial acts.
Animal Control Peace Officers help owners ensure their pets are a positive addition to the community. This is done through education programs, mediating neighbour disputes, providing advice and enforcement.
Officers also patrol neighbourhoods for stray animals and return lost pets to their owners and respond to animals in distress or animals that have been abandoned.
Animal Control Peace Officers are sworn peace officers, giving them the ability to write tickets and lay charges that require a pet owner to appear in court.
They assist the Edmonton Police Service with aggressive or injured animals, Provincial Brand Inspectors with loose livestock and Provincial Conservation Officers with wildlife inside city limits.
Park rangers ensure that the river valley is a safe and enjoyable recreational space. Equally important is our aim to maintain healthy co-existence between the valley's plants and wildlife, and the four million people that visit every year.
Our urban park rangers are knowledgeable in the areas of resource management, wildlife, forestry, outdoor recreation, and law enforcement.

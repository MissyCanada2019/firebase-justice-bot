The Department of Justice provides funding to community organizations and other levels of government that are working to support our mandate, mission and values. Our funding programs are designed to support Aboriginal communities, victims of crime, people with lower incomes, families and young people. We also support projects that help Canadians understand the law and access the justice system in both official languages.

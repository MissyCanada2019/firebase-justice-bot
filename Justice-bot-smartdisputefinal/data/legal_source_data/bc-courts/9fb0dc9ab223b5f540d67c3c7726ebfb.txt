Publication bans prohibit the publication or disclosure of certain information in otherwise open court proceedings. For example, a ban might prohibit the publication, broadcast or transmission of any information that would identify a particular witness or victim in a criminal proceeding. A ban might also prohibit the publication, broadcast or transmission of any details or evidence disclosed at a bail hearing.
Publication bans may be ordered by the Supreme Court pursuant to either statute or the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Some publication bans do not require a court order and are in effect automatically by operation of statute.
A publication ban may preclude a court judgment from being published on this website either indefinitely or until the ban expires. It may also require that a judgment be edited before it is published on the website, which may cause delays in posting.
It is the responsibility of anyone who attends a court proceeding, including in person or by MS Teams, or who accesses court information or judgments, to inform themselves of the terms of any publication bans in effect and comply with the bans. Anyone seeking information about a publication ban in a Supreme Court proceeding should contact the Supreme Court registry at the location where the proceeding is being heard.

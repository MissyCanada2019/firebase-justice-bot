The Supreme Court has developed picklists which set out standard terms for commonly-made orders. Court clerks have electronic access to the picklists and can change the wording of a particular term as the judge or associate judge directs.
The picklists are not comprehensive lists of terms that may be ordered in any given case. Further, it is always within the discretion of the presiding judge or associate judge to determine whether to make an order sought and whether to use the picklist wording in an order.
Lawyers and self-represented litigants may use the Family Order Picklist to assist in drafting notices of applications and orders. This promotes consistency and expediency in formalizing orders.

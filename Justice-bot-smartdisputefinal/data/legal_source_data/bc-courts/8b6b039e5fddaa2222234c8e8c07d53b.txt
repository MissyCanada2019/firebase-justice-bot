Judicial Law Clerk Program
The Judicial Law Clerk Program at the BC Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of British Columbia was established in 1973. The original aim of the Program was to improve the quality of advocacy in British Columbia. Since its inception, the Judicial Law Clerk Program has provided newly graduated law students with a unique opportunity to participate in and observe the judicial system. Alumni of the Judicial Law Clerk Program have gone on to careers in all areas of private practice, public service and business. A number of former judicial law clerks are now members of the BC Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court of British Columbia and the Provincial Court of British Columbia.

Canada Gazette, Part III: Volume 38
Browse and read editions of the Canada Gazette, Part III. This part contains public Acts of Parliament and their enactment proclamations. It is published after these acts have received royal assent. Part III is published, at the request of Justice Canada, whenever there are enough enacted acts to warrant it.
The Department of Justice provides the HTML version of the most recent acts. Please note, however, that some links to HTML chapters are not currently available and that we are working to remedy this situation. In the meantime, it is possible to consult the PDF version.

The table of amendments to statutes provides readers with the amendments made to each statute, their date of coming into force and the reference to the Gazette officielle when the provision came into force under an order in council, for a specific period of time and for statutes integrated into the Compilation of Québec Laws and Regulations.
Starting with the 2016‑01‑02 et 2016‑11‑01 version, the table is now updated by the Service de l’Édition officielle of Les Publications du Québec. In addition, the table now includes the amendments assented to whose date of coming into force is unknown or subsequent to the updated date of the corpus.
The table of amendments to statutes should not be confused with the Table of provisions brought into force, which provides readers with the dates of coming into force of every section in the Statutes of Québec assented to since 1 January 1978.

This table makes it possible to have, on a specific date, for statutes integrated into the Compilation of QuÃ©bec Laws and Regulations, the list of the amendments assented to whose date of coming into force is unknown or subsequent to the updated date of the corpus.
The content of this table can now be found in the Table of amendments to statutes. This page therefore contains the previous versions, which remain available.

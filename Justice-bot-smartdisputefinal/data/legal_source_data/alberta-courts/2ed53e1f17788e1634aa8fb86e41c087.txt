Criminal
Criminal law involves investigating and prosecuting people who may have broken the law; and punishing people who are found to have done so. The Court of King's Bench of Alberta is a superior court of criminal jurisdiction, with the power to try any indictable offence under the Criminal Code of Canada. The Court generally only tries the most serious criminal offences, including murder, manslaughter, and drug trafficking, or conspiracy to commit one of these offences.

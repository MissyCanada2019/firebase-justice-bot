Reviews & Assessments
Role of a Review Officer
Review Officers evaluate lawyers' bills, reducing or disallowing unreasonable charges. Their decisions can become Court of King’s Bench judgments. Clients may seek reviews to check for overcharging or clarify unclear billings. Lawyers may request reviews as a quicker alternative to legal action for unpaid bills. During a review, the officer hears both sides, assesses billing reasonableness, and determines any payable amount.
This page includes links to documents that explain how the review process works, including how to request a review and handle related issues. It also provides the necessary court forms for these processes.
Review Officers also serve as Assessment Officers. They possess the authority to assess court costs claimed by a party under the Alberta Rules of Court or through an award from the Court of King’s Bench or the Court of Appeal of Alberta. The assessment ensures that the claimed costs adhere to applicable rules/awards and are reasonable. After the assessment, they confirm the total amount that should be paid. This page includes links to necessary assessment forms and the outdated but useful Costs Manual, set to be replaced by more current publications.

Contact an MLA
Complete contact information for current Members of the Legislative Assembly can be found on each member’s individual profile page, accessible from our current members page linked below. The profiles contain the constituency, caucus, and ministerial office contact information.
A list of constituency addresses for all members can be found on our member addresses page, linked below. Mailing labels in a variety of formats and e-mail addresses in Excel spreadsheets are also available on this page.
Please note: after a general election it takes time for MLAs to establish their offices.

How Do We Stop the Churn?
This is the second of a two-part series regarding Associate churn. My earlier post focussed on the Associate. This one focuses on the law firm.
The other day, an international client of mine thinking about re-entering the Canadian marketplace asked me why there was so little loyalty in Canadian law firms these days. He was referring to the amount of lawyer churn in most law firms. I donâ€™t believe this issue is limited to Canadian firms, but the question made me think back over my past 30+ years in law firms and how things have changed.

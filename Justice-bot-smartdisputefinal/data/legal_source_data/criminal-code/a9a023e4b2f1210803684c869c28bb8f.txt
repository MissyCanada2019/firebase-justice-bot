Indexation of Fees
The amount of a fee payable under an Act or regulation may differ from the amount indicated in the text displayed on the Justice Laws Website. The Justice Laws Website displays the amount of a fee as enacted, but does not account for periodic adjustments to which it may be subject under the Service Fees Act or other Acts or regulations.
